          <p>
            I know a famous grandmother - not famous as the world measures fame - but famous nonetheless.
            She was, or is, in my opinion, an outstanding expert in child psychology.  Would to God that
            some of our modern specialists could tap into her special well of knowledge - born of love
            and filled with years of devotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is a unique person - that God I had the privilege to become a part of her family.  If
            every child in the world could be nurtured by such a person - be they boy or girl - juvenile
            delinquency would cease to exist and peace would be restored to an unpeaceful world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, I can hear your exclamations of disbelief - but if you do not believe it is only because
            you do not understand, and she, of all people, would forgive you for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you know the desolation of tears?  So does she.  She has buried a husband, a son, and a
            grandchild.  Do you know the laughter of participation in anotherâ€™s' happiness?  I hope so -
            but she certainly did.  Do you understand the need of a neighbor with no on to turn to?  She
            did, and never refused to reach out that helping hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            And most of all, do you understand the responsibility the trust of a child places upon you?
            If you do, please accept that responsibility and teach and love the child.  If not please
            listen and learn how to do these things from this portrait of Dessie.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has been said that youth, like love, is wasted on the young.  Perhaps, if one considers
            love as the blossoming of interest in the other sex.  But more accurately, love can never be
            wasted on the young.  Love is the young.  Children are born into this world awaiting the
            embrace of a mother.  What they receive is a shake and a slap from a doctor.  What a traumatic beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the human spirit is unconquerable and those small beings, barely able to see, start their
            tortuous journey to adulthood.  What should be a beautiful experience in human development
            can and does, all too often, become a frightening experience in human cruelty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except - if one is fortunate enough to have a Dessie in his or her life.  Then, how wonderful
            it can become.
